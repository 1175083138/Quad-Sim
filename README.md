Quadcopter Dynamic Modeling and Simulation (Quad-Sim) v1.00

<<<<<<< HEAD
Provided here is an assortment of materials designed to assist users in modeling and simulation a quadcopter.
Specifically:
•Test rig designs for component performance measurement
•Several MATLAB data analysis tools and GUIs (R2013a Tested)
•A configurable Simulink quadcopter simulation
•And a bit more stuff…

Hi!
Thanks for checking out our project!
>>>>>>> FETCH_HEAD

These materials are partially the result of a Senior Design project at Drexel University. The team consisted of:
D. Hartman, K. Landis, M. Mehrer, S. Moreno, and J. Kim.

As this is our first attempt at a public release of our materials, there are undoubtedly errors, omissions, 
and downright lies contained herein. Expect frequent updates as we find and correct issues.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We do not claim to be experts. All of our materials are provided simply as a service to the 
multi-rotor community in sincere hope that it will prove useful as a basis for further inquiry. Users are 
expected to reference our materials against other more reliable sources, and use their best judgment or 
consult professional advice where appropriate, particularly where safety may be a concern.

Quadcopters and RC vehicles are dangerous and are not toys. 
Use caution and follow all manufacturer safety instructions.

That said, we hope you find these materials helpful. Good luck.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Contained herein is documentation and instructions pertaining to specific tasks. 
A good starting point is to take a look at what materials are provided within these documents.
In general, it is advisable to add all of the MATLAB and Simulink related folders
to the MATLAB path so that they can be easily accessed within the MATLAB environment.
