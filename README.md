Quad-Sim
========

Hi!
Thanks for checking out our project!

Good News: We're working hard to update this space to contain all of our quadcopter modeling stuff! It's going to be pretty cool!

Bad News: Due to an unforeseen change in our team's workload (we were asked to repeat our presentation for a wider audience), we might not have all of our work ready for upload on 5/30/2014 as originally planned. We've determined a new target date of the following Friday, 6/06/2014 by which we hope to have all of our materials online. Please check back in around then!

Thanks,
David
